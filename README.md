üìú Project Description
This project aims to develop a prediction model for the price of Bitcoin (BTC) using Machine Learning techniques. The project is divided into two main phases:

Base Model: Creation of a predictive model using exclusively historical price data (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume).

Advanced Model: Enhancement of the base model by incorporating a new feature: sentiment analysis of financial news, to capture the impact of external factors and market mood.

The ultimate goal is to build a model that not only recognizes patterns in price data but also reacts to the market context, providing more robust and realistic predictions.
